This web-based synthesizer utilizes a similar control style to that of Logic's musical typing (thanks to code modified from https://css-tricks.com/how-to-code-a-playable-synth-keyboard/)

BUGS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM:
- The main issue with the synthesize is that under some circumstances keys will get stuck held down and require a refresh of the website to get unstuck.
